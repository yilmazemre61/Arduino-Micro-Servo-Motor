# Arduino-Micro-Servo-Motor
Level-2-- Include two buttons where button 1(d2) will move the motor forward by 25% and button 2(d3) will move the motor backwards 25%.
Level-3-- Add an RGB led to the circuit. Now have a different light colour appear at each of the motor positions(0,25,50,75,100). If the motor is at 100% and the user hit button 1(move forward) have the motor transition through all colours and position as it returns to 0%. Likewise if the motor is at 0% and the user hits button 2(move backwards) then the motor will hit all the colours and positions automatically as it moves to 100%.
